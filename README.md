# About Case

This case aims to provide key insights for the bank to reduce the customer churn rate in specific geography.

This dataset equips the bank with **data-driven insights** to:

1. **Reduce churn** by identifying at-risk customers.
2. **Improve product offerings** and customer satisfaction.
3. **Design personalized strategies** for customer retention.
4. **Maximize revenue** by retaining high-value customers and cross-selling products.

## Key questions

- What is average churn rate? **Which geography (country) has the highest churn rate?**
- **What percentage of male vs. female customers have churned?**

### 2. Demographic questions

    (Do younger or older customers churn more often?)

    (Are customers who leave within their first year more common?)
    

## **3. Financial Behavior and Churn**

    (Do customers with low or high balances tend to leave?)

- **Is churn more frequent among customers with poor credit scores?**
    
    (Do customers with low credit scores churn at higher rates?)
    

## **4. Product Usage and Membership**

- **How does the number of products used affect churn?**
    
    (Do customers with more products stay longer with the bank?)
    
- **Are customers with credit cards less likely to churn?**
    
    (What is the churn rate among those with and without credit cards?)
